# odata4-service-framework
This project aims to be a starting point for exposing OData4 Services by simply annotating POJO classes,
acting as Entities and Service Controller.

This framework is powered by Apache Olingo Library (https://olingo.apache.org/) and by Spring Framework.

Taking inspiration from the example code of the Tutorial provided by Apache Olingo Library website, I added a number of
helper classes to reduce the boilerplate required to expose OData Services with the Java Language.

This project is just at a starting point stage, and it's not suited to be used in any real production enviroment.
