# odata4-spring-integration
This project aims to be a starting point for using OData4 protocol (powered by Apache Olingo Library,please consult 
https://olingo.apache.org/) in a spring boot enviroment.
Source code follows the tutorial provided on Apache Olingo Library website.
Taking inspiration from the original code, I added helper 
classes that, using custom annotations, reduce the boilerplate code needed to work with OData protocol.

This project is just at a starting point stage, and it's not suited to be used in any real production enviroment.
